# Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)

This folder will contain the frontend application.

Quick start (when scaffolded):

- Install dependencies:
  pnpm install

- Run dev server:
  pnpm dev

- Build:
  pnpm build

Notes:
- The frontend should use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from environment to connect to the API.
- Component library and design tokens live under `src/components`.
