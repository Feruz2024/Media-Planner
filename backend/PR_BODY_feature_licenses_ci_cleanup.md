Summary
- Add robust support for RS256 activation tokens in CI by reading the public key from the repository secret `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and setting `LICENSE_TOKEN_ALGORITHM=RS256` in the integration test job.
- Fix middleware exempt-prefix normalization bug that caused requests to be incorrectly treated as exempt when `'/'` was present.
- Update license verification to accept a PEM string or a path to a PEM file (so CI secrets or files work).
- Remove the dev private key from the repo, add `backend/licenses/keys/` to `.gitignore`, and update `DEVELOPMENT.md` with instructions for secure local and CI key handling.
- Add/adjust unit tests to use realistic request objects (Django RequestFactory), include RS256 test (skipped locally if `cryptography`/key not available), and normalize middleware behavior.

Why
- Per-tenant offline activation must be verifiable in CI with RS256 keys. Embedding private keys in the repo is unsafe. Using secrets and supporting both PEM string and file path makes CI and local development flexible and safer.
- The middleware normalization bug could allow license enforcement to be bypassed unintentionally; fixing it closes a security hole.
- Unit tests were fragile and used unrealistic request objects; making them realistic improves confidence.

Files changed (high level)
- backend/licenses/lib.py — treat `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` as PEM or path; support RS256/HS256 verification and clearer error messages.
- backend/licenses/middleware.py — fix exempt-prefix normalization and small behavior improvements.
- backend/licenses/views.py — activation endpoint uses updated verification flow.
- backend/licenses/tests_*.py — tests updated to use RequestFactory; RS256 test added/skipped locally.
- config/test_settings.py — test-only settings using HS256 for fast local tests.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — integration job now injects `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` from secrets and sets `LICENSE_TOKEN_ALGORITHM=RS256`; guard step added to validate secret presence early.
- DEVELOPMENT.md — documentation about generating keys locally and setting CI secrets.
- .gitignore — ignore `backend/licenses/keys/`.
- (other small commits: removed dev private key, minor tidyups)

Testing performed
- Local: Ran Django test suite under test settings:
  - Command: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.test_settings python -m django test licenses -v 2
  - Result: All fast tests passed locally (e.g. "Ran 10 tests ... OK (skipped=1)"). RS256 test intentionally skipped locally when cryptography/key parsing is unavailable.
- CI: Updated GitHub Actions to run RS256-enabled tests in integration job and read `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` from repository secrets. NOTE: the repository secret `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` must be added in Settings → Secrets for the integration job to run RS256 tests (I confirmed the provided public PEM parses as a 4096-bit RSA key locally).

How to test locally (developer)
1. Fast unit tests (HS256)
   - Ensure test settings are used:
```
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="config.test_settings"; python -m django test licenses -v 2
```
   (Windows PowerShell sample above.)
2. Local RS256 activation flow (optional)
   - Generate a test RSA keypair (do NOT commit private keys):
```
# generate private
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out dev_private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
# extract public
openssl rsa -pubout -in dev_private.pem -out dev_public.pem
```
   - Set `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` to the PEM contents or set `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` to the path.
   - Run the RS256 test or run the specific activation unit tests. The RS256 test is intentionally skipped when cryptography/key parsing isn't available locally.

CI notes / Secrets required
- Add repository secret: `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` — the PEM-encoded RSA public key (not private).
- The integration job sets `LICENSE_TOKEN_ALGORITHM=RS256` and reads `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` from secrets.
- Reminder: secrets are not available to workflows triggered by forks — tests requiring this secret will be skipped or fail for forked PRs. Consider adding a check to skip RS256 integration tests for forked PRs or document behavior.

Security & rollback
- Removed a committed dev private key from the repo and added the keys directory to `.gitignore`. If you need to roll back, the private key must be provisioned outside the repo.
- Public key is safe to store in repo only if it’s public; however, best practices prefer keeping it as a secret in CI to avoid accidental mismatches and storing keys in a single place.

Follow-ups (recommended)
- After merging: monitor GitHub Actions integration run for green status; if tests fail in integration, share the failing job logs and I will diagnose.
- Optionally add a small CI job that verifies `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` format early (PEM parsing) to fail fast and give clearer logs.
- If you want, I can:
  - Open the PR for you (create PR with this body) and add reviewers.
  - Add a small CI job to validate the public key shape in the workflow.

Short message for the PR description (1-2 lines)

Reviewer checklist
- Code & tests
  - [ ] Read `backend/licenses/lib.py` changes: ensure RS256 handling and error messages are clear.
  - [ ] Check `backend/licenses/middleware.py` for the exempt-prefix normalization bug fix and ensure behavior matches security expectations.
  - [ ] Run the updated tests locally (see "How to test locally"); confirm fast tests pass.
  - [ ] Verify RS256 test is marked/skipped appropriately locally and that CI will run it when `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` secret is present.

- CI & ops
  - [ ] Verify repository secret `LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` exists and contains a valid PEM-encoded RSA public key (not private).
  - [ ] Confirm the integration job job has `LICENSE_TOKEN_ALGORITHM=RS256` env var and the key is injected correctly.
  - [ ] Watch the integration job logs for any test failures or missing packages (e.g., `cryptography`) and share logs if failing.

- Security & cleanup
  - [ ] Ensure no private keys remain in the repo (search for `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY` and related files).
  - [ ] Confirm `.gitignore` includes `backend/licenses/keys/` and that secrets are used instead.
  - [ ] Confirm `DEVELOPMENT.md` instructions are clear for local reproduction without committing private keys.

- Merge criteria
  - [ ] Fast test suite green locally.
  - [ ] Integration job green in GitHub Actions OR failing tests investigated and sign-off obtained.
  - [ ] No private keys in repo and CI secrets configured.
