### [Date: 2025-09-05]

**Task**: Project scaffolding and initial backend models
**Status**: In Progress
**Details**: Created Dockerized project skeleton (docker-compose, backend Dockerfile, frontend Dockerfile, `.env.example`). Scaffolded Django backend with `users`, `tenants`, and `stations` apps. Implemented models for `Tenant`, `User` (UUID + role enum), `Station`, `Show`, `Daypart`, and `RateCard`. Added serializers, viewsets, admin registrations, and registered API routes for auth, tenants, and stations. Updated `project_description.md` with explicit field types, RBAC, tenancy/RLS notes, and API shapes.
**Next Steps**: Implement core models (Campaign, MediaPlan, MediaBrief, MonitoringReport, License), generate migrations, and add DRF endpoints. Then scaffold frontend and OpenAPI spec.
**Owner**: Backend Developer


### [Date: 2025-09-06]

**Task**: Generated OpenAPI schema for backend API
**Status**: Completed
**Details**: Added `drf-spectacular` and generated `backend/openapi.yaml` containing API definitions for campaigns, media-plans, monitoring imports/reports, auth, and related resources. Minor warnings emitted during generation about un-annotated serializer method fields (non-blocking).
**Next Steps**: Review the schema for any custom field annotations, add examples to critical endpoints (monitoring import upload), and commit `openapi.yaml` to the repository.
**Owner**: Backend Developer

### [Date: 2025-09-06]

**Task**: Scaffold per-tenant licensing app
**Status**: In Progress
**Details**: Added a new `licenses` Django app with a `License` model, admin registration, serializers, activation endpoint (`POST /api/licenses/activate/`), a simple machine hash utility, middleware to enforce active tenant license, and initial unit tests. Migration file `licenses/migrations/0001_initial.py` was generated.
**Next Steps**: Apply migrations (requires DB connectivity), implement robust signed token verification (replace JSON token placeholder), add management command to export activation requests, and add CI to run tests.
